# Frank — Portfolio Assistant

This project is a personal portfolio site for an experienced IT Programme Manager.  
Its purpose is to present a long and complex professional career in a clearer, more accessible way by combining traditional portfolio content with a conversational interface.

Instead of relying solely on static CVs or written summaries, visitors can ask questions and receive contextual answers about the programme manager’s experience, roles, and delivery history.

## Project Overview

The portfolio combines two main ideas:

1. **A structured presentation of professional experience**  
   Covering leadership roles, programmes delivered, industries worked in, and areas of expertise.

2. **An AI-powered chatbot (“Frank”)**  
   Allowing users to ask natural-language questions about that experience, with answers grounded in real source material rather than generic model knowledge.

The chatbot uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) so that responses are based on a curated knowledge base derived from the portfolio owner’s actual career information.
